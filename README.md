# Jellyfin Custom JavaScript Plugin

This plugin allows you to inject custom JavaScript code into the Jellyfin web UI. It provides a configuration page with a text area where you can enter any JavaScript code, which will then be executed when the Jellyfin web interface loads.

## Install Process

### IMPORTANT: If your Jellyfin server runs on a Docker container without root, then you'll need to perform the following prerequisites

The client script will fail to inject automatically into the jellyfin-web server if there is a difference in permission between the owner of the web files (root, or www-data, etc.) and the executor of the main jellyfin-server. You will see an error in your Jellyfin server logs in this case, like

```bash
[2025-03-09 19:30:41.162 +00:00] [ERR] [1] Jellyfin.Plugin.CustomJavaScript.Plugin: Encountered exception while writing to "/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html": "System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path '/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html' is denied.
```

If this happens, you can mitigate the issue by

1. Run `docker cp jellyfin_server_1:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html /your/jellyfin/config/path/index.html`
2. Update your docker-compose file with a `volume` mapping, like `- /your/jellyfin/config/path/index.html:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html`

This way, the plugin will have appropriate permissions to inject javascript into the index.html file.
